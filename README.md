An [Apache Iceberg](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/) implementation of the Hydrofabric to disseminate continental hydrologic data

> [!NOTE]
> To run any of the functions in this repo your AWS test account credentials need to be in your `.env` file and your `.pyiceberg.yaml` settings need to up to date with `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"` set
>> The `.env` file is used for deploying to the test environment. A `.prod.env` file is used in-place of that if you're deploying to the production environment. By default, when not deploying locally, the test env/catalog is the default; prod needs to be specified when the API/dashboard is launched.

### Getting Started
This repo is managed through [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and can be installed through:
```sh
uv sync --all-extras
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Note: Functionality is split into `optional-dependencies` in `pyproject.toml`. If you only require base functionality, install as `uv sync`. If you require some extras (e.g. `icechunk`, `io`), you can specify `uv sync --extra icechunk --extra io` as needed. For local develpoment, `--all-extras` is recommended for complete functionality.

### Development
To ensure that icefabric follows the specified structure, be sure to install the local dev dependencies and run `pre-commit install`

### Documentation
To build the user guide documentation for Icefabric locally, run the following commands:
```sh
uv pip install ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve -a localhost:8080
```
Docs will be spun up at localhost:8080/

### Pytests

The `tests` folder is for all testing data so the global confest can pick it up. This allows all tests in the namespace packages to share the same scope without having to reference one another in tests

To run tests, run `pytest -s` from project root.

To run the subsetter tests, run `pytest --run-slow` as these tests take some time. Otherwise, they will be skipped

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests validate the deployed test API. These tests are skipped when the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable is not set, so they won't run during normal CI.

To run smoke tests against a deployed environment:
```sh
export API_BASE_URL="http://edfs.test.nextgenwaterprediction.com:8000/"
uv run pytest tests/smoke/ -v
```

The smoke tests currently verify:
- The API health endpoint is reachable
- Numeric fields (`initial_value`, `min`, `max`) in the `parameter_metadata` endpoint are never null
